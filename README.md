#### Warning!
This application does not have neither perfectly designed code, nor SOLID principles implemented. By the time I finished writing this app, I hadn't known much about Design Patterns, clean code or rules like SOLID. Nonetheless, resolving all the problems I have faced, I had come up with ideas like Builder or Decorator pattern, Dependency Injection and Model-View-Controller structure, on my own. That experience helped me a lot with better understanding concepts behind those ideas.
